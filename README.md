# Run VaudTax in a container
## Prerequists
- podman

## How to use
Just clone this repository, ensure you have the prerequists, and run:
```Bash
./run.sh
```

This will build and run a container using ```podman build``` and ```podman run```, and
will start automatically VaudTax application.

## Why?
Because VaudTax doesn't support other Linux than Ubuntu, and there are people on Fedora, CentOS
and other distro. Providing a container is probably the best way to run that app.

## SELinux
This repository provides a .te for Fedora, CentOS and RHEL. You may compile it and install it. The
provided policy will basically allow container_t to access X (beware, NOT tested on Wayland).

In order to compile and load that policy, please run:
```Bash
$ checkmodule -M -m -o vaudtax.pp vaudtax.te
$ semodule_package -o vaudtax.pp -m vaudtax.mod
$ sudo semodule -i vaudtax.pp
```

This will resolv the following AVCs:
```
type=AVC msg=audit(1579630535.776:496): avc:  denied  { write } for  pid=20042 comm="java" name="X0" dev="tmpfs" ino=43290 scontext=system_u:system_r:container_t:s0:c340,c859 tcontext=system_u:object_r:user_tmp_t:s0 tclass=sock_file permissive=0
```

### I don't trust your SELinux policy!
If you want to make your own policy, you can set your system to permissive:
```Bash
$ sudo setenforce 0
```
Then run the following command:
```Bash
$ sudo tail -f /var/log/audit/audit.log | grep denied
```
Finally run the container:
```Bash
$ ./run.sh
```

You can then copy/paste the listed AVCs in a file, and create your own policy:
```Bash
$ cat <your-file> | audit2allow -M vaudtax
$ sudo semodule -i vaudtax.pp
$ sudo setenforce 1
```
And Voil√†.
